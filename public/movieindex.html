<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1464335/">Uncharted</a></h3>
<p>Great action and adventure movie. The story is based on a game and is about finding the treasure that was left by Ferdinand Magellan when he was doing the first circumnavigation of the world.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/">Dune</a></h3>
<p>The visuals in combination with the sound/music are hauntingly beautiful and will stick in your mind for a long time. The movie is slow paced, so if you are accustomed to constant dopamine stimulation than you might find it boring.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2906216/">Dungeons & Dragons:Honor Among Thieves</a></h3>
<p>No need for prior knowledge of anything about D&D. Extremely funny especially the reviving the dead skeleton scene. A cross between Indiana Jones & Lord of the Rings.</p>
